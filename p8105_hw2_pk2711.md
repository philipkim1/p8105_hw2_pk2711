Precipitation (2018 and 2019)

## Data Observations Paragraph

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset (“trashwheel_df”) contains 453 rows and 14
columns. The different `dumpster`s are indicated by numbers and the
`date` corresponds to the date of trash collection. Within these, the
dataset includes dumpster-specific data such as how much trash it has
intercepted which is denoted by the weight of the trash or,
`weight_tons`. Accordingly, the types of trash that are intercepted are
also specified which includes `plastic_bottles`, `cigarette_butts`,
`chip_bags`, and many more. The dumpster that had collected the most
amount of trash by weight was dumpster 62 with a collection of 5.62
tons. In contrast, dumpster 407 had the least collection with a total of
0.78 tons. Accordingly, the median number of sports balls in a dumpster
in 2019 was 9.

As for the combined precipitation data (“precipitation_combined”), it
looks at the total amount of precipitation per `month` by `year`. This
dataset has 24 rows and 3 columns. The total amount of precipitation, in
inches, for the year of 2018 was 70.33 inches.

# Problem 2

## Clean pols-month data

``` r
politician_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month],
    president = case_when(prez_gop == "1" ~ "gop", prez_dem == "1" ~ "dem")) %>%  
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

## Clean snp data

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = factor(month.name[month], levels = month.name),
    year = if_else(year > 15, year + 1900, year + 2000)) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

## Clean unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")

unemployment_tidy_df = 
  pivot_longer(
    unemployment_df,
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_perc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = match(month, month.abb),
         month = month.name[month])
```

## Join Datasets

``` r
snp_pols_df = 
  left_join(politician_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

snp_pols_unemp_df =
  left_join(snp_pols_df, unemployment_tidy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

## Dataset Description

The politician data (“politician_df”) contains 822 rows and 9 columns.
This dataset contains information on how many national politicians were
democratic or republican on the given date. For example, it lists how
many national governors were republican or democratic on a certain
`month` of a particular `year` through `gov_gop` and `gov_dem`,
respectively; and namely, the `president` indicates whether the
president was republic or democratic via values of `gop` and `dem`,
respectively.

The Standard & Poor’s stock market index data (“snp_df”) contains 787
rows and 3 columns. This dataset contains the dates, in `year` and
`month`, and `close` which are the closing values of the Standard &
Poor’s stock index, whcih is an indicator of the stock market at the
given time.

The unemployment dataset (“unemployment_tidy_df”) contains 816 rows and
3 columns. This dataset contains the unemployment percentage at any
given time, which is denoted by `unemployment_perc`.

The resulting data, which is a combination of all the aforementioned
datasets, has 822 rows and 11 columns. This dataset gives valuable
information of the state of the economy given the political standings of
the government. It contains information from January 1947 to June 2015
and between those dates, we see that the highest unemployment rate is
10.8% on November/December of 1982 under the presidency of a republican
president. To contrast, the lowest unemployment rate (2.5%) was in
May/June of 1953 also under the presidency of a republican president.

# Problem 3

## Tidying popularity of baby names dataset

``` r
baby_name_df = read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(

    childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity,
                   "asian and paci" = "asian and pacific islander",
                   "black non hisp" = "black non hispanic",
